These samples show how to use the [Google Cloud Identity Aware Proxy][iap]. Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (Cloud IAP) controls access to your cloud applications running on Google Cloud Platform. Cloud IAP works by verifying a userâ€™s identity and determining if that user should be allowed to access the application.

If this is your first time using the Google Cloud Identity Aware Proxy, try out our [quickstart tutorial][iap-quickstart].

Visit the [Programmatic authentication][iap-programmatic-authentication] and [Securing your app with signed headers][iap-signed-headers] tutorials to learn more about how these code samples work.

You can also learn more by reading the [Cloud IAP conceptual overview][iap-conceptual-overview].

## Setup

1. Deploy this [basic web application to App Engine][iap-app-engine].
1. Once the application is deployed, enable Cloud IAP for it using the Enabling Cloud IAP section of [this tutorial][iap-enable].
1. [Create a service account][create-service-account] that you will later use to access your Cloud IAP protected site. Give it the role of 'Project > Owner' and check the box for 'Furnish a new private key'.
1. Save the service account key you created in the previous step to your local computer.
1. [Grant your service account access][iap-manage-access] to your Cloud IAP application.
1. Visit the [Cloud IAP admin page][iap-console] and click the ellipses button on the same row as 'App Engine app'. Click 'Edit OAuth Client' and note the Client ID.
1. **Install dependencies** via [Composer][composer]. Run `php composer.phar install` (if composer is installed locally) or `composer install` (if composer is installed globally).

## Samples

To run the IAP Samples, run any of the files in `src/` on the CLI:

```
$ php src/make_iap_request.php

Usage: make_iap_request.php $url $clientId

  @param string $url The Identity-Aware Proxy-protected URL to fetch.
  @param string $clientId The client ID used by Identity-Aware Proxy.
```

```
$ php src/validate_jwt.php

Usage: validate_jwt.php $iapJwt $expectedAudience

  @param string $iapJwt The contents of the X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion header.
  @param string $expectedAudience The expected audience of the JWT with the following formats:
```
