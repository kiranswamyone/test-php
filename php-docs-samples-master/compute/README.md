# Google Compute Engine PHP Samples

## Description
This is a simple web-based example of calling the Google Compute Engine API
in PHP. These samples include calling the API with both the
[Google API client](api-client) and [Google Cloud Client](cloud-client) (GA).


 * [Google Cloud Client](cloud-client) (**Recommended**): Under active development, currently in GA.
 * [Google API client](api-client): Stable and generally available, but no longer under active development
