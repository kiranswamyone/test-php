Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. In your world you can create anything you desire. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.

You can do it. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Let's get crazy.

Brown is such a nice color. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. This piece of canvas is your world. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Just a little indication. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Now then, let's play.

I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let your heart be your guide. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

This painting comes right out of your heart. You gotta think like a tree. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Be brave. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Working it up and down, back and forth.
