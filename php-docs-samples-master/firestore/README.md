# Google Cloud Firestore API Samples

These samples show how to use the [Google Cloud Firestore API][cloud-firestore-api] to store and query data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Open the [Firebase Console][firebase-console] and create a new project. (You can't use both Cloud Firestore and Cloud Datastore in the same project, which might affect apps using App Engine. Try using Cloud Firestore with a different project if this is the case).

1. In the Database section, click Try Firestore Beta.

1. Click Enable.

### Authentication

Authentication is typically done through [Application Default Credentials][adc]
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

1. When running locally, use the [Google Cloud SDK][google-cloud-sdk]

        gcloud auth application-default login

1. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with [additional scopes][additional_scopes].

1. You can create a [Service Account key file][service_account_key_file]. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

## Install Dependencies

1. [Enable the Cloud Firestore API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=firestore.googleapis.com).

1. **Install dependencies** via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
    Run `php composer.phar install` (if composer is installed locally) or `composer install`
    (if composer is installed globally).

1. Create a service account at the
[Service account section in the Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/)

1. Download the json key file of the service account.

1. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to that file.

## Samples

To run the Firestore Samples, run any of the files in `src/` on the CLI:

```
$ php src/setup_dataset.php

Usage: setup_dataset.php $projectId

    @param string $projectId The Google Cloud Project ID
```

## The client library

This sample uses the [Google Cloud Client Library for PHP][google-cloud-php].
You can read the documentation for more details on API usage and use GitHub
to [browse the source][google-cloud-php-source] and [report issues][google-cloud-php-issues].

## Troubleshooting

If you get the following error, set the environment variable `GCLOUD_PROJECT` to your project ID:

```
[Google\Cloud\Core\Exception\GoogleException]
No project ID was provided, and we were unable to detect a default project ID.
```

If you have not set a timezone you may get an error from php. This can be resolved by:

  1. Finding where the php.ini is stored by running `php -i | grep 'Configuration File'`
  1. Finding out your timezone from the list on this page: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
  1. Editing the php.ini file (or creating one if it doesn't exist)
  1. Adding the timezone to the php.ini file e.g., adding the following line: `date.timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"`
